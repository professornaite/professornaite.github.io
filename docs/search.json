My goal is to contribute to the world by improving how we learn, our collective knowledge of history and injustice and, importantly, understanding how to integrate and utilize mathematics in these conversations in ways that are “productive” and fun and also critical.\n\n\n\nColumbia University, PhD, 2015 New York University, MA, 2008 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, BA, 2007 National University of Singapore, Exchange Student, 2005\n\n\n\nI have been a teacher for more than 15 years. I am now on the faculty at Howard University where I hold a dual appointment in the Center for Applied Data Science and Analytics and the School of Education. Most recently, I was a member of the faculty at Morehouse College for six years in the Department of Mathematics (I am on leave AY 2023-2024). Prior to Morehouse College, I worked as a professor and high school mathematics teacher in Oakland, CA.\nPlease contact me if you have any questions!"
