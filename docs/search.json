    "text": "Dr.Â Nathan Alexander here and this is my teaching and learning site. I study the role of context in mathematical education, with a specific focus on probability theory and statistical data analysis. My goal is to contribute to the world by improving how we think about history and likelihood, and our collective knowledge of the past and injustice. Most importantly, I have dedicated my work to understanding how we can better integrate theory, quantification, and mathematical thinking into conversations around local and global injustices in ways that remain critical, systems-oriented, and productive to the material lives of our neighbors and the general population.\n\n\nColumbia University, PhD, 2015\nColumbia University, MS, 2011\nNew York University, MA, 2008\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, BA, 2007\nNational University of Singapore, Exchange Student, 2005\n\n\n\nI have been a teacher for more than 15 years. I am a member of the faculty at Howard University, where I hold a dual appointment in the School of Education and in the Center for Applied Data Science and Analytics (CADSA). I was a member of the mathematics faculty at Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA for six years. Prior to my time in Atlanta, I was a faculty member at the University of San Francisco, where I led a group of critical STEM educators, and, at the same time, taught high school mathematics in Oakland, CA. Prior to this period, I taught high school mathematics in New York City and worked as a community educator in Brooklyn.\nI am also the founding director of the Quantitative Histories Workshop, a community-centered teaching and learning lab for students and faculty, especially those at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).
