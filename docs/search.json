It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater segregation.\nIsolation index: Measures the extent to which members of a particular group are surrounded by others from the same group. It represents the percentage of people from a specific group who would need to change neighborhoods to achieve an even distribution. Higher values indicate higher isolation and segregation.\n\n\n\n\nAlgebraic approach\nWe then develop a algebraic modeling approach using methods from mathematical sociology.\nSegregation indices\n\nExposure index: Measures the extent to which members of one group are exposed to members of another group. It quantifies the likelihood that a randomly selected individual from one group will encounter individuals from another group. Higher values indicate higher exposure and lower segregation.\nConcentration index: Measures the extent to which a particular group is concentrated in specific areas or neighborhoods. It reflects the degree of clustering or dispersion of the group’s population across geographic units.\nGini index: Measure of income inequality, but it can also be adapted to measure residential segregation. It provides a summary measure of the overall distribution of different groups across neighborhoods."

Shout out to new members!\n\n\nBefore any data tasks, you will need to develop a practice to developing your expertise for our project. The best way to do this is to progressively build your understanding of the research literature in this area. Please take 5 minutes to read through a new annotation here.\n\n\n\nFirst, we’ll generate a new project. Please open your RStudio IDE.\nNavigate to the following: File &gt; New Project\nA new window will open. In this new window, you will need to name your project.

    "text": "The Fatal Force branch project is one of the core data explorations for our lab members.\nWe are integrating a critical modeling theory (CMT) with a few different data sets to develop a database that will allow our current and future lab members to answer questions about racialized systems, history, and policing at various levels.\nHere, we offer introductory code used to welcome new members to our lab. Shout out to new members!\n\n\nBefore any data tasks, you will need to develop a practice to developing your expertise for our project. The best way to do this is to progressively build your understanding of the research literature in this area. Please take 5 minutes to read through a new annotation here.\n\n\n\nFirst, we’ll generate a new project. Please open your RStudio IDE.\nNavigate to the following: File &gt; New Project\nA new window will open. In this new window, you will need to name your project. As a group, we decided to name the project `fatalv2’ (thanks, Kyshan!) since we will be analyzing the second version of the fatal force data set.\n\n\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t already, you’ll need to load the tidyverse package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\", repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\n\n\n\n\nWe will use a set of specific libraries in the packages that we just loaded. In the tidyverse package, there are some libraries that we’ll need to bring in our data as a .csv file; so we’ll load the entire library.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nPlease navigate to the website for the raw code that we’ll bring into R.\nWe want to bring data directly in from the github repository\nThis data is from the GitHub for Washington Post[^1].
