# Information theory

Information theory is a branch of applied mathematics and computer science that deals with the quantification, storage, transmission, and manipulation of information. We take an abstract approach to our study of information.

  - Information theory seeks to measure the amount of information contained in a *message* or signal and how efficiently it can be transmitted or stored.
  
  - In this way, our projects define *information* using a curricular perspective.

## Research projects

  - ECHO: Education, Community, and Health Observations
  
    - Information and spatial segregation
  
  - Teaching statistical learning and mathematical modeling
  
  - Theory and quantification

## Project group 1: Spatial information and racial isolation

How do patterns of racial segregation inform education, community, and health outcomes?

  - Historical legacies of injustice
  
  - Traditional modeling approaches
  
  - Modern computational tools

# Dividing walls

# Geometric approach

We adopt a **topological** model for spatial segregation on a geographical area, $G$ to develop a theory of dividing walls.

Builds on the topological and topographical work of Short (2011).

**Theorem 1**. Given any configuration of blue and green towns, there is a dividing wall that separates blue towns from green towns.

**Theorem 2**. Alternating configurations of towns do not have a dividing wall, whereas non-alternating configurations of towns do have a dividing wall.

### Algebraic approach

We then develop a algebraic modeling approach using methods from **mathematical sociology**.

Segregation indices

  - *Dissimilarity index*: Measures the proportion of one group's population that would need to move to achieve an even distribution across all areas. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater segregation.

  - *Isolation index*: Measures the extent to which members of a particular group are surrounded by others from the same group. It represents the percentage of people from a specific group who would need to change neighborhoods to achieve an even distribution. Higher values indicate higher isolation and segregation.

### Algebraic approach

We then develop a algebraic modeling approach using methods from **mathematical sociology**.

Segregation indices

  - *Exposure index*: Measures the extent to which members of one group are exposed to members of another group. It quantifies the likelihood that a randomly selected individual from one group will encounter individuals from another group. Higher values indicate higher exposure and lower segregation.
  
  - *Concentration index*: Measures the extent to which a particular group is concentrated in specific areas or neighborhoods. It reflects the degree of clustering or dispersion of the group's population across geographic units.

  - *Gini index*: Measure of income inequality, but it can also be adapted to measure residential segregation. It provides a summary measure of the overall distribution of different groups across neighborhoods.

## Index of Dissimilarity

$$ D = \dfrac{1}{2} \sum_\limits{i=1}^n  \bigg| \frac{b_i}{B} - \frac{w_i}{W} \bigg| $$

  - $n$ is the number of neighborhoods in a geographic region, 
  
  - $b_i$ is the number of Black household units in neighborhood $i$,
  
  - $B$ is the total number of Black household units in the geographic region,
  
  - $w_i$ is the number of non-Black household units in neighborhood $i$,
  
  - $W$ is the total number of non-Black household units in the geographic region,

## Computational approach

Teaching computational methods and open source tools makes for efficient and accurate learning. In about 20 lines of code, there is an immediate intersection.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
#| warning: false

black_georgetown_sc_2020 <-
  get_acs(geography = "tract", state = "SC",
          county = "Georgetown",
                        variable = "B02001_003", # Black or African American Alone
                        geometry = TRUE)
```

  get_acs(geography = "tract", state = "SC",
          county = "Georgetown",
                        variable = "B02001_003", # Black or African American Alone
                        geometry = TRUE)

plot(black_georgetown_sc_2020["estimate"],
     title = "Black or African American alone by county in South Carolina",
       subtitle = "2016-2020 American Community Survey")

Topic modeling research approach in STEM education journals

  - What are the historical trends and patterns in the research on racism as reflected in journal articles?

### Hypothesis 1: Peaks in research occur within some key historical interval $(t_1, t_2)$.

### Hypothesis 2: These intervals are lag models of broader system searches $(t_1, t_2)$.
