## Background

My name is Nathan (my childhood friends know me as Naite) and this is my teaching and learning site. You can see my personal website by visiting https://professornaite.com. My goal is to contribute to the world by improving how we learn, our collective knowledge of history and injustice and, importantly, understanding how to integrate and utilize mathematics in these conversations in ways that are "productive" and fun and also critical.

## Education

| Columbia University, PhD, 2015
| New York University, MA, 2008
| University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, BA, 2007
| National University of Singapore, Exchange Student, 2005

## Experience

I have been a teacher for more than 15 years. I am now on the faculty at Howard University where I hold a dual appointment in the Center for Applied Data Science and Analytics and the School of Education. Most recently, I was a member of the faculty at Morehouse College for six years in the Department of Mathematics (I am on leave AY 2023-2024). Prior to Morehouse College, I worked as a professor at the University of San Francisco and a high school mathematics teacher in Oakland, CA.
