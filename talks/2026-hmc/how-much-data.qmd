[A bit about my ancestors, my journey, teachers, and students.]{style="color:orange;"}

[*A stolen people on stolen land.*]{style="color:blue;"}

My ancestors come from the coast of the Carolinas (NC and SC), where enslaved Africans entered what is now known as the United States. I was born in Charlotte, NC. Meaning that, over time, like many other Black families, there was little movement beyond the South.

![The Carolinas, from the Equal Justice Initiative (2026)](img/carolinas.jpg){width=60%}

My family has very few historical records of our ancestors.

![My maternal ancestors circa 1900](img/_family photo from 1900s.jpg){width=60%}

In 1971, Charlotte, NC, became a national model for school desegregation through court-ordered busing following the landmark *Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education* Supreme Court ruling. [*In 1989, at the age of 5, I would become part of this desegregation plan.*]{style="color:blue;"}

![Busing as a result of *Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education*](img/busing.avif){width=60%}

I was raised in a public housing project in South Charlotte, known as Boulevard Homes in the 90s. These projects were just one exit, a literal two-minute drive, from the Charlotte Airport. This meant that we were in a food and transportation desert next to a busy roadway, Billy Graham Parkway, separated only by a single line of trees.

![Boulevard Homes Public Housing Project, Charlotte, NC](img/boulevard-homes.jpg){width=60%}

Despite our economic conditions, my parents supported our learning and well-being. 

![My 5th birthday party with my sisters and cousins.](img/birthday.jpg){width=40%}

By mere luck, I would be bused to Selwyn Elementary, the #1 elementary school in Charlotte at the time. For context, the surrounding median home value as of Feb. 2026 is $2,524,500^[Houses of South Charlotte: https://www.housesofsouthcharlotte.com/charlotte-nc/selwyn-elementary-school-boundary-map/].

![Selwyn Elementary School](img/selwyn.jpg){width=60%}

[The mathematics of opportunity.]{style="color:orange;"}

As a result of busing, I would have access to educational resources that my first cousins, who lived in the housing project across the street, known as Little Rock in the 90s, would not be able to access. [Their bus took them to a different school on the other side of Charlotte]{style="color:blue;"}.

I recently published a paper on this issue in the *Journal of Negro Education*.

  - Alexander, N. N. (2024). Measuring School Desegregation: A Critical Quantitative Replication. *The Journal of Negro Education, 93*(3), 318-331.
  
In this paper, I discuss a mathematical model used to measure segregation, known as the Index of Dissimilarity, and its relationship to the 70th Anniversary of the 1954 *Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka* Supreme Court decision. [More on this later...]{style="color:blue;"}

$$ D = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n \left| \frac{b_i}{B} - \frac{w_i}{W} \right| $$

[For the love of mathematics.]{style="color:orange;"}

![My first club at Alexander Graham Middle School](img/odyssey.png){width=80%}

I would then spend a summer in Boone, NC with the Summer Ventures Program. It was here that I decided I wanted to be an architect, after spending most of my time building housing structures with balsawood.

![Summer Ventures Program](img/summer-ventures.jpeg){width=60%}

[The transition to my undergraduate studies.]{style="color:orange;"}

![Phillips Hall, UNC Department of Mathematics](img/phillips.avif){width=60%}

[@UNC - Double major in mathematics and sociology.]{style="color:orange;"}

I was the only Black math major in the department.

I would fall in love with coding in my statistics courses in sociology.

![UNC Math Department Newsletter](img/spring-2007-unc-math.jpg){width=60%}


[My 1st math course at UNC]{style="color:orange;"} 

**MATH 89H - First Year Honors Seminar -- Fractals**. *Taught by Sue Goodman, Topologist*.

We spent the first-half of the term making connections to the real world; most literally, going outside to observe tree bark, patterns in the grass, reading books (e.g., The Labryinth), and writing "fractal" poems.

![Fractal Geometry](img/fractal-geometry.png){width=50%}

During the second-half of the term, we would formalize our observations. Starting with the Mandelbrot set and extended it to similar forms, such as the Julia set. A Julia set is a bunch of fractals that are similar to the *Mandelbrot Set*. It is a set defined given a rational function, $J(f)$, such that all nearby values behave similarly when the function is repeatedly iterated.

![A Julia Set](img/julia.png){width=50%}


[My 2nd math course at UNC]{style="color:orange;"}

*Calculus of Functions of Several Variables*

My second math course was in stark contrast to what I had imaged the rest of my mathematical experiences would be in college. I would spend nearly every day after class with Dr. Petersen, building my first honest relationship with a professor.

Dr. Assani, a  Beninese mathematician, joined the UNC mathematics department in 1988 but, for racist reasons, was turned down for tenure. He appealed through the courts, won his case and gained tenure in 1995, and was promoted to full professor one year later. In doing so he became the first Black tenured associate mathematics professor and the first Black full mathematics professor at UNC, as well as the only mathematician there to be promoted from associate to full so quickly (Mathematicians of the African Diaspora, 2014)

![Idris Assani, Ergodic theory](img/assani.avif){width=50%}

[Study Abroad at the National University of Singapore]{style="color:orange;"}

I was selected as part of a first group of students to travel to the National University of Singapore as part of a new exchange program. Given the newness of the program, we would travel early to meet students in Singapore, whose families would serve as our hosts over the holiday break, and they would then leave for UNC at the start of the spring.

![NUS](img/nus.jpg){width=60%}


[My favorite course at the National University of Singapore]{style="color:orange;"}

In *The Horror of the Other*, a humanities and social science elective, we examined the concept of othering. I would write my first interdisciplinary mathematical analysis of social science concepts using the ideas of equivalence relations, sameness, and difference.

[Junior Year back @ UNC]{style="color:orange;"}

At Carolina (UNC), the Department of Mathematics is next door to the School of Education. When I returned my junior year, I would meet Dr. Carol Malloy, a famous mathematics educator and faculty member in the School of Education.

![Carol Malloy, 1944-2015, UNC School of Education](img/malloy.jpg){width=45%}

[Lead Math Tutor at UNC's Upward Bound Program]{style="color:orange;"}

As a result of meeting Dr. Malloy, I would be asked to become the lead tutor for UNC's Upward Bound program. This would be on top of my job as a TA and grader in the mathematics department. I would tutor undergraduates during the week and teach mathematics to high school students on Saturday mornings.

![UNC Upward Bound Program](img/unc-upward-bound.jpg){width=60%}

[Master of Arts in Teaching @ New York University]{style="color:orange;"}

I would accept a scholarship to *NYU* to learn how to teach mathematics. While in New York, I would study under Dr. Karen King, who taught me theories of education and the pedagogy of mathematics. [Dr. King would challenge me to create culturally relevant math lessons]{style="color:blue;"}.

![Karen King, 1971-2019, MAT advisor](img/karen-king.jpg){width=40%}

[Student Teaching]{style="color:orange;"}

Pre-service teachers are required to complete about 200 hours of student teaching in a local high school. I was placed at a school for recent Chinese immigrants in the Lower East Side (LES) of New York at the LES Community School. [Here, I created my first ethnomathematics unit plan]{style="color:blue;"}.

![Camping trip with students from Lower East Side Community School, 2008](img/student-teaching.jpg){width=50%}


[Teacher of Record]{style="color:orange;"}

My first teaching experience as the teacher of record would be in Bedstudy, Brooklyn, NY at a middle school for Boys. I would move from Brooklyn to Harlem to teach at the Harlem Children's Zone. [I would be tapped by the COO, George Khaldun, to support org-wide statistical analysis with external, mostly white, business consultants. Given their lack of contextual knowledge, I became interested in getting a PhD to combat their deficit narratives of the youth and families]{style="color:blue;"}.

![TRUCE @ Harlem Children's Zone](img/hcz.jpg){width=40%}

[PhD program in Mathematics and Education @ Columbia University]{style="color:orange;"}

I would go on to study in the Program in Mathematics at Teachers College, Columbia University. The first program of its kind in the country. In this program, 75 credit hours over 5 years, we take [PhD courses and qualifying exams in mathematics]{style="color:blue;"} (I completed exam requirements in Topology/Geometry, Statistics & Probability Theory, and Analysis) and advanced [theory courses in mathematical education]{style="color:blue;"}. This allows us to work in both departments of mathematics and schools of education.

[Doctoral work as a Gradaute Research Assistant]{style="color:orange;"}

I studied under Dr. Erica Walker, who studies the histories and social networks of Black mathematicians. As her graduate assistant, I would begin my initial foray into archival research as she completed her book, *Beyond Banneker*.

[Department of Mathematics @ Morehouse College]{style="color:orange;"}

I became a visiting professor in the Department of Mathematics at Morehouse College. In this role, I focused on supporting students during their transition from high school to college, thinking largely about my first-year experiences in mathematics as an undergrad at UNC.

![My first class at Morehouse College](img/morehouse.jpg){width=50%}

[Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) in Mathematics]{style="color:orange;"}

I also helped launch a summer research program at Morehouse for local high school students. I would teach a first course on [abstraction, mathematics, justice]{style="color:blue;"}. This program, the Summer Math and Science Honors Academy (SMASH) is supported by the Kapor Foundation.

# Quantitative history

![*Historie Quantitative* by Pierre Chaunu](img/quanthist.jpg){width=50%}

## The quantitative historical methods {background-image="https://www.cjr.org/wp-content/themes/cjr2017/images-body/Rosenthal-van.jpg" background-opacity=0.25}

Quantitative history applies statistical methods and numerical data to analyze historical patterns and trends over time. It emerged prominently in the mid-20th century, particularly through cliometrics in economic history.

Our lab examines problems of injustice over long periods of time. 

While social scientists may focus on politics and policy within short horizons — such as ten years in the past or five years into the future — we work integrate insights from history to track trends across much longer spans, like $\pm 100$ years.

# Mathematical sociology

![*Journal of Mathematical Sociology*](img/math-soc.jpg){width=50%}

## Integrating intuition and formal modeling {background-image="img/man-with-magnifying-glass-with-risograph-effect-remixed-media.jpg" background-opacity=0.25}

Mathematical sociology uses mathematics to formalize and refine sociological theories more precisely than verbal descriptions allow. It focuses on constructing models that abstract social phenomena, derive predictions deductively, and reveal common patterns across diverse topics like networks or diffusion processes.

Some common tools include game theory for collective action, stochastic processes for influence spread, and algebraic models for kinship structures. It bridges micro-level decisions (e.g., rational choice) and macro structures.

## Lessons from 20th Century Black Educational Leaders

- **Community-Centered Approaches:**  
  _Education should serve the real, expressed needs of African American communities._

- **Multiple Pathways:**  
  _Rejecting a single model, these leaders blended classical education, technical skills, cultural pride, and civic leadership._

- **Curriculum as Empowerment:**  
  _Math, science, and humanities can all be agents for liberation if connected to real lives._

## Racism vs. Anti-Blackness {background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Blackboard.png?20200731124623" background-opacity=0.5}

In a 2020 NY Times article, kihana miraya ross chronicles the realities of anti-Blackness. [ross (2020)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/george-floyd-anti-blackness.html) deals with the related but differing functions of racism and anti-Blackness.

- Black existence is considered a problem (see Du Bois, 1903)

- Antiblackness is not simply a synonym for racism against Black people (Gordon, 1997; ross, 2020; Sexton, 2008; Wilderson, 2010)

- Antiblackness describes an antagonism "between blackness and (the possibility of) humanity” (Dumas & ross, 2016, p. 429)

- One example of evidence is in our collective neighborhood and housing practices in the U.S., namely, the issue of proximity to (poor) Black people; these are considered "legacies of slavery" (Wynter)


## The Racial Contract  
<small>Charles Wade Mills</small>

![Essay by late Jamaican philosopher Charles Wade Mills (1951-2021)](img/racial.jpg){width=40%}

- The "social contract" is a theory in moral and political philosophy concerning state authority over individuals, often presented as neutral regarding race/ethnicity
- Mills argues these ideas create a “racial contract” that has regulated relations between whites and non-whites; these narratives are relegated by what he calls oppressive and non-oppressive societies that manage, for example, our academic work
- We extend this work to the relations between Black and non-Black persons - and we argue that these relations are [social]{style="color:red;"}, [emotional]{style="color:red;"}, and [spatial]{style="color:red;"} in both form and function.

## Information and spatial segregation

[How have histories of racial segregation informed education, community, and health outcomes?]{style="color:blue;"}
  
[Chodrow (2017)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708201114), examines residential segregation using a taxonomy of smoothing-based segregation metrics, we consider key historical components and markers in the development of a history of "dividing walls".

  - *Historical legacies of injustice*. "The 1968 [Fair Cities] Act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, sex, (and as amended) handicap and family status." ([US Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/aboutfheo/history), n.d)
  
  - *Traditional modeling approaches*. What has been done more recently and historically?
  
  - *Modern computational tools*. What new (grounded) theoretical insights can be identified?

# Geometric approach

We adopt a **topological** model for spatial segregation on a geographical area, $G$ to develop a theory of dividing walls. Builds on the topological and topographical work of Short (2011).

**Theorem 1**. Given any configuration of blue and green towns, there is a dividing wall that separates blue towns from green towns.

### Segregation indices

  - *Dissimilarity index*: Measures the proportion of one group's population that would need to move to achieve an even distribution across all areas. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater segregation.

  - *Isolation index*: Measures the extent to which members of a particular group are surrounded by others from the same group. It represents the percentage of people from a specific group who would need to change neighborhoods to achieve an even distribution. Higher values indicate higher isolation and segregation.

  - *Exposure index*: Measures the extent to which members of one group are exposed to members of another group. It quantifies the likelihood that a randomly selected individual from one group will encounter individuals from another group. Higher values indicate higher exposure and lower segregation.

---

## Index of Dissimilarity

$$ D = \dfrac{1}{2} \sum_\limits{i=1}^n  \bigg| \text{Proportion of Black units} - \text{Proportion of non-Black units} \bigg| $$
  
- $n$ is the number of neighborhoods in a geographic region, 

- $b_i$ is the number of Black household units in neighborhood $i$,

- $B$ is the total number of Black household units in the geographic region,

- $w_i$ is the number of non-Black household units in neighborhood $i$,

- $W$ is the total number of non-Black household units in the geographic region.

## Computational approach
    
Teaching computational methods and using open source tools makes for efficient and accurate learning. In about 5 lines of code, there is an immediate intersection of theory and computation. We use the `tidycensus()` package to gather various metrics and extend the previous models.

## Current project: Mapping Multidimensionality

We explore how multidimensional measures of local communities -- such as those provided by the Census Community Resilience Estimates (CREs) -- can be used to frame and model dynamic changes in neighborhood communities using an intersectional lens.  We build on prior research inspired by work on the United States as a "Patchwork Nation."

## Project background: Information and spatial segregation

### [Information and theory]{style="color:blue;"}

::: {.incremental}

Information theory is a branch of applied mathematics and computer science that deals with the quantification, storage, transmission, and manipulation of information. 

[We take an abstract approach to our study of information.]{style="color:blue;"}

  - Information theory seeks to measure the amount of information contained in a *message* or signal and how efficiently it can be transmitted or stored.
  
  - This project seeks to define *information* using a critical computational perspective.
  
  - Namely, how might we [leverage computation and quantification]{style="color:blue;"} to transmit information efficiently [while maintaining the roots of complex theories and histories?]{style="color:blue;"}

## Analytic framework: Community Resilience Estimates

- The Census Community Resilience Estimates (CRE) data sets were developed to [assess the social vulnerability and resilience of neighborhoods]{style="color:blue;"} in response to disasters or shocks.

  -- Households with an income-to-poverty ratio less than 130%

  -- Less than one individual living in the household is aged 18–64
  
  -- Household crowding, defined as more than 0.75 persons per room
  
  -- Households with limited education
  
  -- No one in the household is employed full-time year-round
  
  -- Individual with a disability posing a constraint to significant life activity
  
  -- Individual with no health insurance
  
  -- Individual aged 65 or older
  
  -- Households without a vehicle
  
  -- Households without broadband internet access
  
## Analytic framework: Community Resilience Estimates

- CRE estimates are a [measure of the capacity of individuals and households within a community]{style="color:blue;"} to absorb, endure, and recover from external stresses. 

- The CRE data combine American Community Survey (ACS) and the Population Estimates Program (PEP) data to [identify social and economic vulnerabilities by geography]{style="color:blue;"}.

- There is a nice [CRE Interactive Tool](https://mtgis-portal.geo.census.gov/arcgis/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=54292fa3918e425a8717259f930274fb){target="_blank"} that allows for a quick overview of local contexts.

## Dimensionality in Spatial Models

### [Model development]{style="color:blue;"}

::: {.incremental}

-- Base spatial model formulation: $$ \boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{X}\beta + \tau + \epsilon $$

- $\boldsymbol{y}$ is a $n$ x $1$ response vector

- $\boldsymbol{X}$ is a design matrix that contains explanatory variables

- $\beta$ represents fixed effects coefficients

- $\tau$ denotes spatially dependent random errors

- $\epsilon$ represents independent random errors

:::

## Dimensionality in Spatial Models

### [Model development]{style="color:blue;"}

Response vector structure ($\boldsymbol{y}$): 

$$
\begin{align}
    \boldsymbol{y} &= \begin{bmatrix}
           y_{1} \\
           y_{2} \\
           \vdots \\
           y_{n}
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align} 
$$

- Each element, $y_i$, represents the observed response at a neighborhood's location $i$

- These are ordered by adjacency relationships to preserve the geographical context

- Also, review of distributions, spatial autocorrelation (i.e., $Cov(y_i, y_j)$), and decomposition

## Dimensionality in Spatial Models

### [Model development]{style="color:blue;"}

Design matrix of explanatory variables structure ($\boldsymbol{X}$):

$$
\boldsymbol{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_{1, 1} & \ldots & x_{1, p} \\
1 & x_{2, 1} & \ldots & x_{2, p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{n, 1} & \ldots & x_{n, p} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- First column is the intercept term

- Subsequent columns represent $p$ explanatory variables

- Each row corresponds to a specific neighborhood's covariates

## Dimensionality in Spatial Models

### [Sample design matrix of explanatory variables]{style="color:blue;"}

$$
\boldsymbol{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 65,000 & 0.62 & 3,200 \\
1 & 28,000 & 0.32 & 5,100 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
1 & 127,000 & 0.75 & 6,840 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- Column 1 is the expected value of $\boldsymbol{y}$ when all other predictors are zero

- Variable 1 (column 2) as median income

- Variable 2 (column 3) as the proportion of residents with a high school diploma

- Variable 3 (column 4) as population density (residents/sq. mi)

## Information and spatial segregation

### [Model selection]{style="color:blue;"}

There are multiple models for consideration:

::: {.incremental}

-- `Spatial regression using intersectional interactions`

-- `Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)` with CRE components

--  `Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Analysis (MAIHDA)`

  - Evans et al. (2024). A Tutorial for Conducting MAIHDA. *Population Health*, Vol. 26, 101664

  - Combines intersectional stratification with neighborhood-level clustering

  - Models individuals nested within: Intersectional strata (e.g., low-income Black men), community typologies from framework (e.g., Patchwork Nation) classifications

## Next Steps: An HBCU Open Science Network

- **Goal**. Collaborative networking within/across HBCUs to share resources and ideas.

- **Funding**. We received funding to support HBCU faculty with developing open-source data science modules and materials, strengthening data science infrastructure at their institutions. We just received bridge funding to expand this work.

- **Partners**. We are building an HBCU faculty network in partnership with The Carpentries to develop and share culturally relevant and social impact resources, and address the unique needs of HBCU students and faculty as it relates to open science.

- **Building community.** Bridge funds will support collaborative site visits, idea generation, and grant proposal development. Our first virtual meeting is in July for those interested in joining and helping to expand the network. Please be in touch.
